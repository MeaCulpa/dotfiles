MA vs CB vs Potency

 Multi Attack vs Crit Bonus vs Potency

    Edit: This post is now slightly out of date due to some sweeping gear
    changes that came with GU63 (Skyshrine). The basic principles still apply,
    but some stats are much easier to get than they were at the time that I
    originally wrote this post.

    So, I'm still trying to optimize my dps setup with the gear that I have
    access to, and sort of wanted to check up with other folks to see if my
    observations about how Multi Attack, Crit Bonus and Potency correlate are
    correct.

    ---

    Multi Attack

    From what I can tell, this is the quickest and easiest way to boost one's
    auto attack DPS, and seems to be overall more important than other auto
    attack related stats. (DPS Mod, Haste / Attack Speed, AE Auto Attack, etc)

    It does however suffer from diminishing returns, but since most of our gear
    doesn't offer huge amounts of Multi Attack, going too high doesn't seem to
    be something we have to worry too much about as Wardens.

    The tiers of Multi Attack damage increase appear to be to be as follows:

    000% Multi Attack - 1 swing 100% Multi Attack - 2 swings, 100% increase in
    auto attack damage from 0% MA 200% Multi Attack - 3 swings, 50% increase in
    auto attack damage from 100% MA 300% Multi Attack - 4 swings, 33% increase
    in auto attack damage from 200% MA 400% Multi Attack - 5 swings, 25%
    increase in auto attack damage from 300% MA 500% Multi Attack - 6 swings,
    20% increase in auto attack damage from 400% MA 600% Multi Attack - 7
    Swings, 16.7% increase in auto attack damage from 500% MA

    It would be pretty difficult to get a Warden's Multi Attack beyond 600%,
    but adding more swings wouldn't actually be much more of an increase from
    that point on. The basic principle to keep in mind is that the more Multi
    Attack you already have, the less adding more Multi Attack on is going to
    increase your total auto attack damage, and thus your DPS.

    It's also important to keep in mind (as far as I can tell) that extra Multi
    Attack swings don't trigger procs or anything like that - just the initial
    attack. With this in mind, Haste / Attack Speed is something that shouldn't
    be ignored, but can also be somewhat difficult for Wardens to increase
    without either group buffs or putting on gear typically meant for other
    classes. (ie, Strength / Agility-based armor and jewelry) Multi Attacks CAN
    score critical hits though, and can also miss independently from each
    other. (Unlike Flurry, which ceases to attempt more swings even if it
    misses just once)

    If you've got a nice weapon (Preferably 2-Hand) and are pretty good at
    timing your combat arts and spells so as not to delay your auto attacks,
    you can count on your auto attack damage to make up 30-60% of your dps,
    (Higher end solo, lower end in raids.)

    Edit: Also, Multi Attack past the 600% mark suffers a HUGE amount of
    diminishing returns. After 600, each point of MA is only equivalent to 25%
    of what the value would have been before 600. Put simply, you'll need 1000
    MA before you get your 8th swing.

    ---

    Crit Bonus (And PvP Crit Bonus)

    I've recently learned that Critical Bonus starts to become really helpful
    for increasing one's dps particularly once we reach around 400% Multi
    Attack.

    The general idea behind wanting more Critical Bonus is that this stat
    affects basically ALL of our outgoing damage, including auto attack hits,
    offensive spells, and combat arts, provided that we have enough Crit Chance
    to overcome an enemy's Critical Avoidance.

    In PvP, the highest Critical Chance one should ever need is 100%, whereas
    in PvE one will need 100% + Whatever the enemy's Critical Avoidance stat
    is, which can usually be examined in a monster's buffs. PvP Crit Bonus,
    (Which is a separate stat from "regular" Crit Bonus) is possibly the single
    most important stat for dealing damage to players in a PvP environment,
    since your PvP Crit Bonus will need to be higher than your opponent's PvP
    Crit Mit in order to actually deal Critical Damage at all. (Provided you
    also have 100% Crit Chance, which shouldn't be too difficult, especially at
    level 90).

    When deciding to choose whether to gear or adorn for Multi Attack or Crit
    Bonus, I typically use the following formula:

    Quote Originally Posted by Lupuos View Post

    A simplified formula to just compare ma and cb is as follows: [ma effect] =
    ([ma increase] /(100 + [current ma])) [cb effect] = ([cb increase]/(([base
    crit factor] * 100) + [current cb]))

    if [ma effect] * { the % auto attack of your total dps } > [cb effect] then
    go for the ma effect otherwise go for the cb effect

    If you have 2.5 (1) flurry count as 7.5 (3) ma you can see the difference
    on that too.  For reference:

    Priests: Base Melee Crit: 1.30 Base Spell Crit: 1.20 Base Heal Crit: 1.30
    Base Taunt Crit: 1.30

    The idea behind Lupuos' formula is that if you're increasing Multi Attack,
    you're actually only increasing a specific portion of your overall dps
    (Auto Attacks). Crit Bonus on the other hand, will affect all of your
    outgoing damage, barring most procs from gear and a few other abilities.
    Because our Base Crit as Priests is already kind of low, we reap a larger
    benefit from increasing our Crit Bonus than other classes like Mages and
    Scouts, who have a Base Crit value of 1.5 for their Spell Crit and Melee
    Crit, respectively.

    I've found that in general, Multi Attack is a lot easier to increase than
    Crit Bonus, so I usually get a bigger benefit out of Crit Bonus because my
    Multi Attack is already quite high. However, if you're starting out with a
    low amount of Multi Attack and relatively high Crit Bonus, you may find
    that Multi Attack will give you a bigger bonus to your overall dps.

    What this boils down to is that there isn't an easy answer for someone
    asking "Should I get more Crit Bonus or more Multi Attack?" or "How much
    Crit Bonus is equivalent to how much Multi Attack?" The correct answer is
    that it depends on your character's current stats, and will take a bit of
    math to figure out which will net a larger increase in your overall dps.

    ---

    Potency

    The last piece of the puzzle I've been fiddling with is Potency. I feel
    like I see people trying to decide between whether to increase Crit Bonus
    or Potency fairly often, and are usually given the quick answer of "Mages
    and Shamans want Potency, everyone else wants Crit Bonus".

    I assume that people think this way because most Mages don't usually
    utilize their Auto Attack very much, and probably get a bigger bang out of
    Potency than Crit Bonus. While it's true classes that do use their Auto
    Attacks will get a big boost out of Crit Bonus, (Since Crit Bonus increase
    the damage of Auto Attacks, while Potency does not) it's important to
    remember that Potency still does affect the other (Sometimes larger)
    portion of our damage: Spells and Combat Arts. Potency also has a nice
    affect of increasing our heals, and makes a particularly big difference for
    our elemental damage absorber, Ward of the Untamed.

    Potency and Crit Bonus work in a multiplicative way, so it's generally a
    good idea to increase the two numbers somewhat evenly in order to get a
    bigger bang. For example, let's say you have 10 Crit Bonus and 10 Potency.
    (I'll use small numbers to make it easier for me to explain) There's an
    opportunity to put a new adornment in a slot, and you can choose either a 5
    Crit Bonus Adorn, a 5 Potency Adorn, or a 2.5 Crit Bonus / 2.5 Potency
    Adorn.

    Which will net more damage? We can test it out:

    10 x 15 = 150

    OR

    12.5 x 12.5 = 156.25

    It may seem like a small difference, but with larger numbers, it really
    starts to add up.

    Illustrating the importance of keeping mulitiplicative values becomes
    increasingly apparent when the numbers get even farther apart.

    1 x 9 = 9 2 x 8 = 16 3 x 7 = 21 4 x 6 = 24 5 x 5 = 25 (This is the kind of
    relatationship that you want: Numbers that are close together!)

    The other tricky thing about the relationship between Crit Bonus and
    Potency is that not only are they multiplicative, but also that our
    starting Crit Bonus is higher than some people realize. If you hover over
    your Crit Bonus tool tip, you'll see that we have base Crit Bonus values of
    1.3 for Melee, Heals and Taunts, and 1.2 for Hostile Spells. This basically
    means that even if you're getting no Crit Bonus from any of your gear or
    abilities, you'll still have a 1.3 multiplier any time you crit.

    I'm guessing that the same principle used for the Multi Attack vs Crit
    Bonus formula can be used to make a modified equation for Potency vs. Crit
    Bonus as follows:

    [pt effect] = ([pt increase] /([current pt]) [cb effect] = ([cb
    increase]/(([base crit factor] * 100) + [current cb]))

    if [pt effect] * { the % non-auto attack of your total dps } > [cb effect]
    then go for the pt effect otherwise go for the cb effect

    So, when choosing between Crit Bonus and Potency, particularly for Healing
    or Spell and Combat Art Damage, it's usually best to keep the two values as
    close together as possible, while remembering that your actual Crit Bonus
    is actually 30% higher than what your Crit Bonus value appears to be. (Or
    20% higher for offensive spells) It's also important to keep in mind that
    increasing one's Potency also increases the cap for how much Ability Mod
    will help our spells and combat arts, since the benefit of Ability Mod
    ceases at 50% of an ability's base value. (Potency effectively increases an
    ability's base value!)

    HOWEVER, (and this is important!) IF your character has an abundance of
    Multi Attack and Crit Bonus, Potency will play a smaller role in boosting
    your overall dps, since a larger portion of your damage will be based on
    Auto Attack, which Potency does not affect. Even though Crit Bonus and
    Potency being closer together will yield larger Combat Art and Spell Hits,
    it's likely that there will be more tools at your disposal to increase your
    overall Auto Attack Damage than other abilities. (Stats that increase Auto
    Attack Damage include Multi Attack, DPS Mod, AE Auto Attack, Haste/Attack
    Speed, Weapon Damage Bonus, Base Auto Attack Multiplier, Accuracy, Weapon
    Skills, and Wisdom)

    ---

    So Basically...

    To sum it up simply, for DPS, it appears that:

    Multi Attack > Crit Bonus > Potency, (Most of the time) but managing which
    stat to increase over another will be dependent upon how much of each stat
    you already have.

    But if you're just looking at healing, most of the time you're going to
    want to focus on Potency over Crit Bonus, due to the multiplicative nature
    of Potency and Crit Bonus and our base Crit Bonus Modifier.

    I think this is more or less how this all breaks down, but am always
    learning new tricks from other forums and players. I usually don't like to
    get into the nuts and bolts of games like this, but have found that trying
    to break down the mechanics and really figure them out has really helped me
    become more efficient and effective at dealing damage on a healer.

    When trying to pick which stats to increase, it's vital to be conscious of
    what your current stats are, before blindly assuming that just because
    someone says that one type stat is better than another that their
    assumptions are going to be appropriate for your gear and AA setup. It's
    best to assume that just because something looks like a great upgrade to or
    for someone else, it's not necessarily going to be the best upgrade for you
    too.

    If anyone else has any other tips or insight, I'd love to compare notes and
    welcome corrections to any of my observations!

Planning
---------



All You Did Was Hang Around And Eat Our Eggs!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Walk up the ramp ( 481, 364, -533 )  and slay Warbird Jarkin's Advisors

2. Windcaster Ortan, ( 511, 409, -551 ) , 32^ (First House)

3. Featherseer Tolmak, ( 607, 412, -527 ) , 32^ (Third House) 

4. The Final step is to slay Warbird Jarkin himself. He can be found ( 571,
   423, -546 ) . Make sure you kill him last, or the quest may not update,
   forcing you to wait until he respawns. 


Straight and to the Point
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Kill 15 Krukiel Bugbears in Butcherblock Mountains for weapons. But you can
   kill Krulkiel Grunts( 150, 223, -183 )  instead 

2. Return to Ninoin D'syl ( 306, 0, 404 ).


AA Spec
-------

Rogue Line (100 pts)

STR (5, 10, 10, 1, 8)
AGI (4, 10, 10, 1, 4)
STA (0, 0, 0, 0, 4)
WIS (-)
INT (7, 7, 8, 1, 4)

Brigand Line (100 pts)

Since one of your two functions in a group is debuffs (and who wants to run
with a Brigand who can't use Dispatch?), your Potency line is key. From an
increase in your Poison's debuffing to an increased duration for Dispatch, this
line has what you need to make a mob seem underconned. With the end result
being an increase in both your CA and Poison duration, maxing out Potency is a
must.

More debuff goodness can be found in the Afflictions line, which culminates in
a nice ability that lowers the targets AoE radius, keeping those casters on the
fringe healthy.

Finally, when you get to 70 points spent, start dropping everything into your
Sentinel's fate line (but not Help for the merciful) and max those out. Each
one has a hefty damage increase or a nice extra debuff to stack with the
debuff. When you have 10 pts in SF attributes, spend your next one on the end
ability Cornered. Cornered is a VERY nice AoE high damage and high mitigation
debuff of the tune of 2000+ points.

Brigand Shadows Line (70 pts)

Your general and Scout line are gimmes. Increase your speed and food duration,
and improve the reuse speed on Cheap Shot and max out your Offensive Prowess
for that extra shot of DPS. The Rogue tree has a couple of nice items, but
you'll definitely want to max out Poison Mastery for an additional 15% poison
damage to stack with what you got from the Potency line in the Brigand tree.
Make sure to pick up Thieving Essence as well for a nice boost to the groups
ability modifiers. Finally, the Brigand line has buff to your already
impressive Dispatch CA, so max that out and since you maxed out Avast Ye
(Agility 3 in the Rogue tree), make sure to max out Plankwalker as it boosts
the proc rate of Avast Ye. You'll have enough point to get both of the Brigand
end abilities, so no need to wrack your brains over which one to grab.

Poison
------

Poison Use:

    To use a poison, you must place the vial in one of the two
    "activatible" slots on the inventory window. Right click and select
    "Use". You may need to "attune" the poisons before you can use it. Once
    you have used it, an icon will appear in your "buff bar". The icon will
    note the maximum time the effect will last if it does not fade from use
    (the proc count is not noted).  It is possible to apply multiple
    poisons, but after testing (by others), only one, first applied, of
    each proc rate (i.e. 25%, 15%, or 20%) and/or each type (damage or
    debuff) will proc until it is dissapated.

        Because you can stack poisons with different proc rates, this means you can apply and have them all proc together:
            a normal damage poison (i.e. small direct damage with large damage over time, 25%)
            an extreme damage (i.e. a rare poison that has a larger damage component, 15%)
            a common debuff (i.e. poison debuff, 20%)
            a rare debuff (i.e. slow, 15%) 
        If a poison is applied after another poison of the same proc rate
        (i.e. a large direct damage with small damage over time, 25%, is
        applied after a moderate direct damage with moderate damage over
        time, 25%), only the first one will proc until it is dissapated
        when the second one will take over.  A "proc" is when the poison
        effect goes off along with a swing (or shot for ranged) of the
        weapon.  Proc is short for "process", a term first coined for the
        extra effect in the days of the first MUDs.  Without using combat
        arts and not counting death (which currently wipes away all poison
        applications), in normal fighting, poison has been found to last
        approximately (not exactly, there is some deviation based on
        fighting and other factors) -
            25% proc rate with 200 procs (normal damage crafted): 40 minutes
            20% proc rate with 80 procs (common debuffs): 20 minutes
            15% proc rate with 30 procs (most rare debuffs): 10 minutes 
    
    Common Crafted: Player crafted potion made with a glass that was made
    from a loam from a common harvested precious metal or gem (loam is a
    by-product of refining the metal or gem into a reagent for making dye
    and ink).  Rare Crafted: Player crafted potion made with a glass that
    was made from a loam from a rare harvested precious metal or gem.  NPC
    Bought: Potion that is purchased from an NPC merchant. Only damage
    poisons are available from NPC merchants.
    
    All poisons have an applied maximum duration of 12 hours unless the maximum proc count is reached.
    Proc Rates:
        Common crafted: Damage poisons will proc a maximum of 200 times
        before fading. Many debuff poisons will also proc 200 times though
        some may have a lower rate, as noted in the examine window.
        
        Rare crafted: Poisons with a common and NPC counter-part (i.e.
        medium direct damage with medium damage over time) will proc a
        maximum of 200 times before fading. Poisons with "extreme" damage
        or a special damage or other effect will proc fewer times, as noted
        in the examine window.
        
        NPC bought: All proc a maximum of 100 times before fading. 
    
    Poison applications are not removed with death.

Please do not post in this section of eq2flames unless you have read this.

This post is for us to discuss tip and tricks.

Keep in mind that the information below is NOT a "You must do this or else," but rather my personal set up which can serve as a starting point. It is important to test out different set ups yourself to see what combination will make you the best Brigand that you can be.

Epic Walkthru
http://www.eq2llinks.com/epic3.php
At Level 90, you can do a quest that will strip the Mythical Effect into a spell so that you can upgrade your weapon without losing the Mythic benefit.
http://eq2.zam.com/wiki/Epic_Convers...uest_Series%29

Stats
Agility is the number one stat for Scouts. 1930 raid buffed is your ultimate target. Thats the break point for 10% potency from agility. (Rasix)
Stamina would be a very distant second, about half as much as your Agility.
The others don’t really give you enough benefit to worry about.
You are looking for Max Debuffing and DPS.

Your Crit Chance and Double Attack should be high enough that you can reach 100% when group/raid buffed.
Then you want to work on your Haste Mod, DPS Mod, Crit Bonus, Potency, and Ability Mod. You can bump these up through the use of adornments.

Casting Order
My casting order is always being tweaked while I look for the best order for
personal and raid dps. Thieves Guild is cast on the bard in the group. Once I
have run through the order, I repeat them as they come back up, keeping an eye
on the reuse of DoM so that I have a set of 8 ready to go for it.

    Pre-pull if up
    Deceit
    Ruthless Cunning
    Sneak

    Rob
    Mug
    Thieving Essence
    Desperate Thrust
    Dispatch
    Debilitate
    Murderous Rake
    Master Strike (if applicable)
    Double Up
    Dance of Metal
    Battery and Assault
    Bum Rush
    Shank
    Evasive Maneuvers
    Black Jack
    Backstab
    Puncture
    Will to Survive
    Traumatic Swipe
    Evade
    Cornered
    Hood of Thugs
    Stunning Blow
    Torporous Strike
    Shadow Slip
    Boot Dagger
    Walk the Plank
    Gouge


Auto Attack
As Auto Attack is approximately 40% of our damage, I try to time the attacks:
CA - CA - Pause - CA - CA - Pause... rinse and repeat

Rogue AA's
There were some major changes with Sentinel’s Fate. You are no longer putting points directly into STR, AGIL, STA, etc.
You should pick AA’s that closely follow your playing style. Don’t be afraid to test out a set up and reset it to test another.

Here is an AA Calculator you can use and then post the link for others.
http://www.beetny.com/eq2aa/

Raid DPS spec

My tank sucks dick at aggro


Adornments
See the Gear thread by Soulphage

Also, here is a nice Adornment by Slot site http://adornments.h0b0.net/

Other Tips
1. Use Cornered on single mobs or partway through the fight when AEing to avoid stripping adds from the tank. (Siden)
2. If there is an Illy in your group, ask them for Time Warp. Time your DoM string to be within Time Warp for a strong boost to your DPS (Rasix)
3. Double Up no longer breaks DoM sequence, but will not proc a trigger. If you are lagging, you may run out of time to get in the whole DoM sequence.
4. Double Up does count as a spell - Important to know if you are fighting a spell-reflecitng mob such as Kastus (Soulphage)
5. You can Dispatch two mobs at once through use of Double Up: Target one mob - Dispatch, target second mob - Double Up (Rasix)
6. For poisons, Caustic is a better choice than Hemotoxin






Just adding some more info for clarification, personal preferences that differ
and reasons why. Not trying to pick on you Myst, but you gave me a good basis
to organize my thoughts so forgive me for the many quotes.

exact number is 1930. thats the break point for 10% potency from agility.

I have a lot of differences here:

I agree with pre-fight setup.

Thieving Essence
I feel that this should be a part of the beginning CA chain, pre DoM. This is
due to the fact that it adds Ability Mod and therefore increases the damage of
all CA's after.

Battery and Assault
This should be the opening CA of the DoM chain because of the synergism
involved with the Rogue AA line - 8% accuracy to BA. This helps you to not lose
your DoM chain due to a missed CA.

Double Up
Debilitate outstrips, albeit barely for me, BA on overall damage.

Rake also has a 25% increase in both damage and critical damage via the Brigand AA tree.

For those reasons they should be your last 2 hits in DoM if you plan on hitting
Double Up immediately after the last DoM hit. If not, they should still be your
primary 2 double up choices. substitute Sinister Strike for Debilitate if able.

Evasive Maneuvers inside DoM chain
Purely Aggro dropping reasons. helps ensure that the mob doesn't turn on you
during your last 2 DoM hits and blow the most important 2 of the bunch.

Fast reuse CAs like Bum Rush and Puncture
Early and Often. Solo my Bum Rush does 4689 dmg on an 8.5 second reuse.
compared to Stunning Blow (just an example) which does 5728 on a 25.4 second
reuse. This means in a 60 second period I'm going to get Stunning blow in twice
for just over 11k damage, compared to Bum Rush 6 or possibly 7 times (7th at
59.5 seconds) for 28k. Not to mention the damage from items that proc a % of
time off of a CA like bloodfrenzy.

I also like to make sure that my last 3 CA's of my DoM chain are all higher
damage abilities, in the off chance that you actually have your double up hit
the last 3 ca's instead of 2.

given these points I have my cast order as follows:

    Rob
    Mug
    Thieving Essence
    Desparate Thrust
    Dispatch
    --Dance of Metal--
    Battery and Assault
    Bum Rush
    Shank
    Backstab
    Evasive Maneuvers
    Black Jack (debilitate if able to sin strike)
    Debilitate (or sin strike)
    Rake -< Last CA in DoM chain
    ---Double Up---

Not too picky after this point.


As far as AA specs go, different strokes for different folks I guess.

Mine is:

Rogue
    Str - 8 4 10 1 8
    Agi - 10 4 10 1 8
    Sta - 0
    Wis - 0 0 0 0 8
    Int - 10 0 0 0 0
    DoM - 2

Brigand
    Potency line - Rake, Thrust, Debilitate, Dispatch, Tenure
    Defending - Street Smarts, Barroom
    Tactics - Sneak, Evade, Shadow Slip, AR, Safehouse
    Afflictions - Puncture (3), Rob, Mug, Gouge, BnA

    Advanced Strike, Murderous Intentions, Debilitating Strikes, Cornered.

Shadows
    Constitution, Strides
    Quick Strike, Offensive, Sin Strike, Evasive
    Flurry, Circle (3), Endurance, Poison, Thieving
    Rugged (3), Stunning Blow, Distracting, Plank Walker, both endline. 





There was some talk awhile back about the benefits of moving Debilitate out and replacing it with B&A due the Red Adornment screwing with the recast timers. The talk died down pretty quick though, but I think it's because most of those doing the talking left the game (or just stopped posting).

That said it seems a bit contrary to the class role to wait that late to cast Deb and Rake. Are you doing it just to keep from having to use crappy AA abilities to trigger the last few procs of DoM? Doesn't seem like that should be necessary, but I've only been playing by Brig for a short while (switching, or at least mixing mains) so I don't know much and most likely there is a reason I have not thought of yet.

That said here's the rotation I've been playing with:

Precast: Same
On Pull

    Rob
    Mug
    Desperate Thrust
    Thieving Essence
    Dispatch
    Debilitate
    Murderous Rake
    <Master Strike>
    Double Up
    <DOM>
    Battery & Assault
    Bum Rush
    Puncture
    Backstab
    Shank
    Evasive Maneuvers (until I'm mastered out it has a higher Damage per cast)
    Will to Survive
    Black Jack
    Stunning Blow
    Cornered


My CA order:

    Gouge(if i can get it in before the mob turns)
    Lucky Break/Mug
    Debilitate
    Rake
    Dispatch
    Double Up(or Sinister and then Double up)
    BnA
    Bum Rush
    Puncture
    Backstab
    Shank
    Stunning Blow
    Desperate Thrust
    BD/Rob
    Will to Survive
    Evasive Maneuvers
    Black Jack
    Thieving Essence
    Torp Strike
    Trauma Strike
    WTP
    Cornered
    Barroom Negotiation

And i keep going back and hitting anything that pops, i can get 3 bum rushes
and 3 punctures in before i finish the order.

I hit Debilitate and Rake before dispatch because they're 1 min 21 sec duration
and 54.5 reuse so they're up all the time > Dispatch w/ 24 sec duration imo.
BNA for increased accuracy, then Bum Rush and Puncture because they pop back up
so fast as i said above. Backstab and Shank to get dots rolling. From then on
its all about keeping similar reuse timers together and ordering by highest
average hit, though t strike, swipe and wtp go at the end of single targets
because their damage sucks ass.

I've also tested using Thieving essence at the start for the ability mod and it
didn't make any difference for me.

I hit DoM right off the start too and normally finish it even hitting DU after
the first 3 CAs unless i get kicked or stunned or whatever. 



A few other interesting things of note and something I tested with a friend tonight.

-Cornered and Barroom Negotation (aoes) will proc all 8 DoMs (if there are 8 mobs and the aoe hits them all). I don't know if that's good or bad, but I bet it's a sure way to rip add-aggro off of the tank.

-If you are going in to a multi-mob encounter, AoEs are best to start the fight (they will be reuseable sooner). Cornered will increase the group/raids dps at the start as well.

-I'm not so sure about doing Debilitate and Rake before Dispatch or pre-DoM. I do agree with using DoM sooner rather than later.

-Debilitate and Rake do not share the same cooldowns of 54s, after you get the red reduce reuse Debilitate adornment. However, if you have your Doubleup casting order similar to this:

precast
---blah blah blah---
-DoM-
Dispatch
Debilitate
Muderous Rake
Doubleup
Battery and Assault

Then (interium Doubleup) using Debilitate and Battery Assault ASAP when they
are available, on the next Doubleup rotation you should have available (nearly
all at once) :

---blah blah blah---
Dispatch
Murderous Rake
Battery and Assault
Doubleup
---blah blah blah---

In essence, all you are doing is rotating Debilitate and Assault and Battery in
and out of your Doubleup routine, without skipping a beat. Also, DoM should be
ready every other doubleup routine, if timed well.

I suggest using an epic dummy to practice this. Usually I run out of power at a
little after 2 minutes (just right-click the dummy, stop encounter). You should
be able to pull-off 3 Doubleup routines in that time frame.

Disclaimer: This is, obviously, only relevant to perfect scenarios where there
is no stun/mez, there is no joust, there is no port, there is no knockback,
there is no death.
