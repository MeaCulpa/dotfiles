I'm doing stupid keyboard revamp SOE screwed up
I'm a left-hander
Default sux for me
I don't have numpad, mini keyboard. And I don't use numbers
I sometimes don't even have a mouse connected...
The most stupid thing is that mapping a key will not remove the original mapping
I'm a noob, totally
Do SOE have Member... I always thought SOE is a dummy company, no real-human, just robots
:)
I just wanna save my config into a label in Other
But it sux, when I load it there  is nothing
I joined the 1st week EQ2 released
Left the 20th week I think
